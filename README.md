# Predicting Clinical Trial Success

Introduction

Clinical trials play a pivotal role in advancing medical treatments, representing a cornerstone in the quest for new drugs and therapies. However, the journey from initiating a trial to achieving success is fraught with challenges, with a mere 7.9% of trials reaching fruition. This study focuses on identifying patterns within clinical trial data that may serve as predictive indicators of a trial's success. Drawing from a comprehensive dataset obtained from the World Health Organization's registry for COVID-19 trials, we explore factors such as trial quality, duration, and demographic considerations.

Goal Description

The primary objective is to unravel the intricate interplay of variables contributing to the approval of a drug. By analyzing historical data, we aim to create a model that can forecast the outcomes of future trials. This exploration is not only an academic pursuit but also holds practical significance for the biopharmaceutical industry.

Learning Type

The study primarily adopts a supervised learning approach, training the model to recognize patterns associated with successful outcomes. Additionally, the possibility of incorporating unsupervised learning methods will be explored to identify hidden patterns within the data.

Personal Interest

This project holds personal significance as it combines professional interests with a profound personal connection to COVID-19. As I have lost my father to COVID-19, this research had a lot of emitional attachments.

Approach

The project's success hinges on effective problem framing, data framing, and objective framing. Each aspect is carefully addressed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the clinical trial data and the factors influencing trial success.

Methodology

The methodology encompasses problem framing, data cleaning, model selection, hypothesis formulation, and model evaluation. Hypotheses related to trial duration, sponsor experience, and gender usage are tested using logistic regression and other relevant algorithms.

Results

The analysis reveals diverse trial durations, prevalent single-gender inclusion, and consistent reporting of completion dates. Models exhibit high accuracy and F1 scores, indicating successful training and robust predictive capabilities.

Conclusion

Insights gained from the study can inform strategic decisions in clinical trial optimization, contributing to the collective pursuit of medical advancements. The methodology offers a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and underscores the successful performance of the models.
